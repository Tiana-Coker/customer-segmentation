# Customer Segmentation and Profiling for Targeted Marketing

This project analyses customer data to identify groups of customers with similar shopping behaviour and characteristics. The aim is to understand customer differences and support more targeted marketing decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information on approximately 16,900 customers. It includes customer demographics, household composition, shopping behaviour, spending across product categories, promotion usage, store visits, complaints, and transaction history.

## What This Project Does
- Prepares and cleans customer data for analysis  
- Groups customers into meaningful segments using clustering methods  
- Profiles each customer segment based on behaviour and spending patterns  
- Uses insights from the clusters to propose targeted marketing strategies  

## Methods Used
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for exploration and visualization  
- Hierarchical clustering to explore customer group structure  
- K-Means clustering for final customer segmentation  

## Tools
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Output
The project produces customer segments, clear profiles describing each group, and practical marketing insights based on observed customer behaviour.
